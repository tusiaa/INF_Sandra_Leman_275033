6645,2022-05-11 05:47:28+00:00,I saw The Bad Guys and it was really cute! Beautiful art style and excellent action sequences. Kung Fu Panda 2 remains the prettiest cg Dreamworks animated movie imho but this one was up there.
6646,2022-05-11 05:36:48+00:00,"someday, an IT person who used to work at dreamworks will leak all the meshes and materials for their characters, and it'll be fuckin over from that point on"
6647,2022-05-11 05:33:18+00:00,ok but the real question is do u think Spirit voiced by matt damon from the 2002 Dreamworks film is hot?
6648,2022-05-11 05:17:41+00:00,"@Blaze_The_Foxx Plus DreamWorks excels in the sequel department. Other than the third Shrek movie, all their sequels have been just as good, or even better than the original"

7815,2022-05-07 07:25:54+00:00,"DreamWorks at least had a precedent.

The other studios kind of hit a 2 out of 3.  Despite my concerns about introspection, I think the closest would be a Miyazaki-era Ghibli film, if only because of Miyazaki's previous work in Lupin III (which has been noted as an inspiration)."
