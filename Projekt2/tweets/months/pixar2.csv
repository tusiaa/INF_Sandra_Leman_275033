- The jokes do not sound funny to me.

15415,2022-02-17 13:20:39+00:00,@ChaseRazor .... The trailer makes the animation looks less than up to par with Pixar's previous work and the main character look unlikable. Does that make me look racist?

15420,2022-02-17 13:13:49+00:00,@GaleriaLin I would say treat it like how Pixar treats Toy Story; do a sequel if the story is equal in quality to the previous and don‚Äôt half-ass it till the eleventh hour.

22362,2022-02-26 18:13:00+00:00,I think Tangled was Disney‚Äôs last truly heartfelt and earnest attempt at a well-rounded animated feature (not including Pixar projects)
22363,2022-02-26 18:11:48+00:00,I think the film being about marine life provides a very good reason for being CG animated - same with PIxar bringing to life toys and insects. I‚Äôm not sure traditional animation could be as impactful for this story specifically.

Even tho imo it‚Äôs starting to look more like that at its worst. Even the weakest of Pixar in the older times looked a lot more unique than other animated films.
23263,2022-02-27 15:41:19+00:00,And animation has a powerful way of invoking that when given the right people.

23269,2022-02-27 15:41:08+00:00,I see a lot of people tend to defend this and judge Pixar animation saying its just as good as it is based on its rending/ texture achievements alone. Pointing at movies like Toy Story 4 and the Lightyear movie to say why Pixar is still doing good. I feel people miss the point.
23270,2022-02-27 15:41:07+00:00,I‚Äôm still disappointed in Pixar‚Äôs animation. Not even just because of Turning Red looking a bit creepy (It does) but nothing from Pixar today feels like they‚Äôre experimenting the right things to do with animation. I‚Äôm gonna make a thread on this.
