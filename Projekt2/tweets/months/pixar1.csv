5833,2022-01-08 21:07:39+00:00,"21) On the whole, the Pixar story is such a fun one for me. Great lessons in this book about: 

-creating a culture of feedback and risk-taking
-mgmt lessons
-the Pixar-Disney story"
5834,2022-01-08 21:07:38+00:00,"20) Disney animators were not rewarded for taking risk or speaking up unlike at Pixar where direct feedback from anyone was impt. 

Ed didn't want to make Disney animation like Pixar, but that was an impt part to change so that Disney animation could come back."
5835,2022-01-08 21:07:38+00:00,"19) Ed talks about how when he was tasked with helping Disney animation around (post-acquisition of Pixar), he realized that there were many things about their culture that had prevented them from creating stand out movies the last decade."
5836,2022-01-08 21:07:37+00:00,"15) The braintrust at Pixar also doesn't offer solutions. They just provide feedback on how they feel about the work. It is up to the respective movie teams to fix it. 

In some cases, fixes were very minor but in other cases, fixes could involve changing a story almost entirely."
5837,2022-01-08 21:07:36+00:00,"12) Despite this interesting history, a lot of the book talks about setting up company culture and learnings along the way. 

Eventually, we all know that Disney later came back and bought Pixar &amp; the book talks about culture, M&amp;A, and leadership."
5838,2022-01-08 21:07:36+00:00,"11) Going IPO was the right business move, because they negotiated hard with Disney after Toy Story. Disney inevitably wanted to work with Pixar again, but this time Pixar could demand a lot more."
5839,2022-01-08 21:07:36+00:00,"10) In fact, beyond the initial $5m investment into the company, Steve had to inject a lot more capital into Pixar before Toy Story just to keep it alive. 

That is amazing faith from an investor."
5840,2022-01-08 21:07:35+00:00,"7) Although this sounds like an amazing investment in retrospect, Pixar was floundering. 

They were trying to sell hardware - machines that other ppl could use to make animations and then could later make their own movies. 

But there was no product-market fit."
5841,2022-01-08 21:07:35+00:00,"6) No banker or VC was interested in buying this studio. 

Except eventually Steve Jobs personally took an interest in this. He paid Lucasfilm $5m for the rights and injected $5m into Pixar company to be spun out as an independent entity and he owned 70% of the business."
5842,2022-01-08 21:07:33+00:00,"2) I was excited to dig into this one, because I had previously listened to Bob Iger's audiobook which talked a fair bit about the acquisition of Pixar and the integration.

20005,2022-01-25 14:51:53+00:00,@PhDan_ As far as Pixar goes I immediately shifted my top 5 for it. I loved the creativity and passion of it. Being a kid a daydreaming of things you don't understand. Having insecurities while being innocent. I really loved everything about it.
20006,2022-01-25 14:50:31+00:00,"P.S. From what I understand, much of the reason all those Pixar movies we love so much are so, so good is because they created systems that invited tentative, nuanced self-critique. Science calls this ‚Äúattempting to disprove the hypothesis.‚Äù Religion calls it ‚Äúrepentance.‚Äù"
20007,2022-01-25 14:49:31+00:00,This thought spurred by a post that claimed Disney was right to remove Pixar movies from cinemas because encouraging parents to bring their kids to theatres would be associating with mass killing.
