11294,2022-04-29 00:40:32+00:00,@Dreamworks I would not blame them if they did. They are all so good ü§© Good to see that they are doing the right thing!

11296,2022-04-29 00:36:17+00:00,@KingBlanketfort I dunno why but your art style reminds me of the art style of the Prince of Egypt movie if Dreamworks did more movies like this they should hire you as a character designer.

Man, Activision has a lot of enemies"
