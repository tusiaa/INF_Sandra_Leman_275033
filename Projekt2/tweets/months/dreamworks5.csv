2257,2022-05-07 07:25:54+00:00,"DreamWorks at least had a precedent.

The other studios kind of hit a 2 out of 3.  Despite my concerns about introspection, I think the closest would be a Miyazaki-era Ghibli film, if only because of Miyazaki's previous work in Lupin III (which has been noted as an inspiration)."
2258,2022-05-07 07:15:55+00:00,"Every studio has duds, though.  That doesn't make them a bad studio; it just means they tried their best but the whole doesn't mesh well.

That being said - to me - DreamWorks' history probably makes it where this version of ""The Bad Guys"" was possible."

Cartoon Network wouldn't have the adult-themed easter eggs.

Is DreamWorks perfect?  No; Trolls sucks, the Boss Baby is ludicrous, Bee Movie should be consigned to hell, and Shark Tale is probably best left un-talked about."
