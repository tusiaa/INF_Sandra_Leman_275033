DreamWorks is just one of the bunch. They will hardly change."
7031,2022-02-24 06:18:20+00:00,"Also, I haven't been as much a fan of DreamWorks as I am of Disney, or similar animations, but I recognize that they did a good job previously (for example, Over the Hedge, is my favorite DW movie), but now all of their movies are a joke in bad taste, and completely heartless."
