6119,2022-03-17 12:31:21+00:00,"@Richmond_Lee The frame modulation stuff is awesome and feels like a natural progression of stuff that dreamworks started on maddagascar, where they started to remove inbetween frames to mimic closer to chuck Jones wile cyote stuff."
6120,2022-03-17 12:27:48+00:00,@Richmond_Lee I feel like this has always been dreamworks strength as a studio. Ever since kung fu panda they've been allowing themselves to commit to full on just... Being cool. Like they were actually making adventure/action movies when almost no one else in US animation was.

10356,2022-03-30 01:23:40+00:00,"@CharMayCry I will also agree and stand on that Cars 2 is one of their few best movies, because compare to Good Dinosaur and Onward it was one of the memorable movies. Dreamworks on other hand can have a bad movie but be very memorable (Sharktale), or is bad and very boring (Abominable)."

10389,2022-03-30 00:04:26+00:00,@0215MADman @CharMayCry Abominable was the first and I think only production from Dreamworks' short-lived Chinese studio and that makes its blandness make... slightly(?) more sense. I think that studio later got sold to a company within China who closed it down and poached all the talent.
