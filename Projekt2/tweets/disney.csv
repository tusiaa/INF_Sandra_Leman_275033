9993,2022-06-01 14:44:43+00:00,"@NovusIacobus People need to detach themselves from the Disney-esque understanding of nature as peace, animals as brethren and more of the classical understanding of nature as raw survival. 

We had Laudato Si, now we need Non adeunt animalia."
9994,2022-06-01 14:44:43+00:00,glee is on disney plus!!!! time to watch britney/brittany and grilled cheesus
9995,2022-06-01 14:44:41+00:00,Kinda crazy how the thing everyone was mad about last week is forgotten when Disney made their call to action. Stop being manipulated by brands.
9996,2022-06-01 14:44:40+00:00,"@Rainbow_Pixelz It's just frustrating to me how much credit people give to Disney, the same Disney that edited that gay kiss from Star Wars and reduced Finn's role because China is racist. My heart goes out to the show writers for confirming it and not backing down, but man!!"
9997,2022-06-01 14:44:39+00:00,"@MetalSD_68 @Disney @starwars They can indeed.  

I saw the first Obi-Wan episode--I don't like the 3rd Sister-she seems one-dimensional.  That's not the fault of the actress.  She's playing the part she was given.

Will it get better?  I don't know--I don't plan on watching."
9998,2022-06-01 14:44:37+00:00,OBI-WAN KENOBI IS ALREADY THE BEST DISNEY+ SERIES AND I WILL DIE ON THAT HILL
