A very good place close to the subway (that comes straight from/to JFK Jamaica st.).
It has all the essential stuff for travelers who are not booking hotels to spend all their time there :)
Bed was comfortable, restroom/shower was working without any issues. No noise from the streets.
You can come back whenever you want, because there's always someone at the reception.
After reading some of the comments I was thinking that we may get dissapointed,
but we were pleasantly surprised for what this place offers for this price/location compared to others.
Definitely recommended for backpackers!
