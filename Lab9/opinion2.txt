Heed my word - in all my days on this earth, never have I had the opportunity
to stay in such an impoverished hole of ‘hotel’: the rooms were absolutely
boiling with no air conditioning, we had to keep our door fully open for an hour
before we could sleep, which given the clientele, was a worry,
the plug socket on the wall was destined to give you a one ticket to god and
every man and his dog were banging doors in the hall at ungodly hours.
Probably wouldn’t advise staying but you get what you pay for.
